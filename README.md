* What has already happened?
* Where is this happening?
* What is currently happening in the surrounding environment?
* Randomness / Chance / Probability
* Internationalization
* Localization

More generally this project is a work-in-progress towards integrating formal methods and natural language.
We can call this style of turn-based programming "Interaction Programming."
